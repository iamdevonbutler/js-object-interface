document object cloning param.

in readme, suggest the deepKey pattern as a means for more readable code

need a way to console log object. obj.log();

obj.info() maybe there needs to be an attach info method.

functional-object-assign w/ tests

  // @todo what if a key is invalid, will the reduces return throw an error?
